"Hey there!"
"Well, you sure are lost, aren’t you?"
Yeah, I’m trying to get back to the surface.
Wait... what are you?
"What am I? How rude!"
"I’m an Anglerfish, obviously."
"Someone wasn’t paying attention in school..."
"Anyhow, you said you’re looking for a way back to the surface."
"Well, I suppose I could help you, though you’ll need approval from our queen first."
"How do you get her approval? Well, through combat, of course!"
"I’ll take you to her now."
"Hop on my back, land dweller."
