Mission objective: Acquire the panacea...Cleared.
What a day. I can’t wait for it to be over.
Maybe those clowns at Conch Labs can finally give me a promotion.
I mean, retrieving the panacea from the depths of the ocean?
That’s gotta be worth at least a raise.
Alright, time to move. I'll use the WASD keys to move around.
I have to use the "E" key to interact with objects.
For jumping, just hit the SPACE key. Easy peasy!
Time to go home, I need to press the red button on the terminal to start the auto-navigation system.
